			description: ["This weird box with a wierd name is a very special backpack. It has a small number of slots, but an uncapped stack size. So one slot can hold more than 64 items.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this is for the miners out there who like to dig a lot of stuff for a long time, holding massive quantities of cobblestone and ore, while keeping you from having to fight constantly for inventory space.\\n\\nAs you upgrade it, it will gain more slots and a higher slot capacity. Higher-tier dank/nulls can hold several thousand items in a single slot."]
